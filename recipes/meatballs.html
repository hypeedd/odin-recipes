    <p>These giant lazy meatballs are truly beautiful. Forget that we used just about the laziest method ever to make them, with no slicing and dicing, the taste and the texture are that of a properly made, high-quality meatball.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Meatballs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large slices stale white bread, crusts removed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley (optional)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the top</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crumble bread into a bowl and mix in milk thoroughly using a fork. Let stand for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine beef and pork in a large bowl and mix well using 2 forks. Add salt, black pepper, oregano, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, olive oil, Parmesan, parsley, eggs, and the breadcrumb mixture. Mix using 2 forks until everything is evenly combined. Wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a roasting pan or baking dish. Using damp hands, roll 4 giant meatballs, and place in the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until an instant read thermometer inserted near the center of meatballs reads 160 to 165 degrees F (71 to 74 degrees C), 40 to 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove meatballs from the oven, and spoon tomato sauce evenly over meatballs. Sprinkle first with Monterey Jack cheese, and then with Parmigiano-Reggiano.</li>
        <li>Return meatballs to the oven, and bake until sauce is hot and cheese is melted, 5 to 10 minutes more. Top with parsley and serve.</li>
    </ol>
